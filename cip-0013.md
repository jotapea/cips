## Abstract ##

CIP13 is an alternative to CIP3, focused on the use case of "asset name reservation". Specifically, allowing (unlocked) assets to switch their divisibility if these have never previously issued any quantity or description.

## Motivation ##

With CIP3 [almost ready](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/issues/54) to be released, there needs to be an alternative implementation that solves the same root cause problem with different tradeoffs. While CIP3 specifies its target users, CIP13 is set to benefit Counterparty (and Bitcoin) more broadly.

As someone that has been admiring the accomplishments of this protocol for the last couple of months, I was surprised about the lack of challenge to CIP3 from the perspective of designing for the efficient use of Bitcoin. CIP3 uses the "reset" term as if a blockchain asset could ignore its history. But in principle, there is no reset for a Bitcoin asset.

The implementation of this reset adds too much complexity to the core of Counterparty, and these changes are ONLY to be able to change divisibility in some limited specific cases (especially if most asset names have yet to be issued). In addition, CIP3 breaks the simple cohesive elegance of issuances and destruction calculations, as the quantities in either of these tables can have multiple divisibility interpretations (instead of just being a single interpretation shared by all quantity data). And in CIP3 the descriptions of these reset issuances are not even considered.

CIP13 is simple. It is mostly about conceptually separating the asset name reservation use case from the rest of the issuance possibilities. If the (unlocked) asset has never issued a quantity or a description, it can be considered an "undefined" asset. Then undefined assets could, if needed, "switch" their divisibility with the first quantity or description defining issuance.

This provides a clear intention of not committing to how an asset will be used from the genesis issuance, for the benefit of the same issuer or the next (a resold asset name).

## Rationale ##

The rationale of CIP3 ends with: "I cannot see anyone being harmed by allowing this". And I believe this framing is what has allowed CIP3 to be implemented with a "free pass", downplaying the effect this change is having at multiple places in the protocol. Even the api documentation has been made more [complex](https://counterparty.io/docs/api/#create_issuance) ([before](https://web.archive.org/web/20220525232957/https://counterparty.io/docs/api/#create_issuance)).

First time Counterparty developers will now need to understand this "reset" as part of the MOST FUNDAMENTAL concept of an asset, its issuance. A "reset" is opposite to the foreverness of Bitcoin.

CIP3 is also affecting the support of Bitcoiners who value blockspace use efficiency. The existence of a "reset" allows issuances and destructions that happen before a "reset" to become unwanted (but always there, "wasting" blockspace, and being able to do this multiple times).

In contrast, CIP13 promotes not using the assets that are not ready to be used.

CIP13 looks into the future, focusing on the root problem which is not having to commit to divisibility with the asset's genesis issuance. Keeping the asset's history as clean as possible, while also keeping the protocol simple and efficient (all aligned with Bitcoin).

## Specification ##

The `create_issuance` API call doesn't change, no new flags are required. The asset divisibility switch will just happen "behind the scenes", with the first time the asset adds a quantity or a description, and the divisibility doesn't match the one set at genesis. After an asset has issued a quantity or description, the divisibility cannot be switched. So, the divisibility automatic switch is only needed once, or not at all.

In summary: with CIP13 divisibility is not final until an asset has issued a quantity or description (or lock).

## Example use case ##

Alice is interested in reserving the COOL asset name, she has no specific plans to use it, and reselling it is also an option. Alice should make this genesis asset issuance without specifying any quantity or description. Because the UI/UX considers this an undefined asset, the divisibility options were not shown. The COOL genesis issuance was done with the default `divisible:true`.

Months later, Alice found a buyer for her asset, Bob. Alice only needs to transfer the issuance privileges of COOL to Bob.

With a "clean" asset history (as in no quantity or description ever), now Bob has the freedom to decide the divisibility he is interested in with his first quantity or description issuance. Or he can transfer COOL to a new buyer.

Bob decides to use COOL by issuing quantity 5 without a description, the divisibility options were presented, and Bob selects `divisible:false`. The issuance was successful because Counterparty allowed switching the asset divisibility with a first quantity definition. COOL became an indivisible asset with quantity of 5.

With CIP13 divisibility is set by the first person DEFINING the asset, not by the person that just wants to RESERVE the name.

# Milestones

**DONE** - Create CIP that replaces CIP3

**Next (TBD)** - Implement CIP13

**Finally (TBD)** - Merge and release CIP13
